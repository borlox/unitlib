+ What is unitlib?

Unitlib is a programming library written in C, that handles parsing, converting
and formatting of SI units (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI).

+ Is there any documentation?

Not yet, but you may look at the unitlib.h header where each function has a 
short description.

+ Features of unitlib
 
 * Parsing of complex unit definitions like "5 kg mm / 16 ns^2".
 * Extensible rule system to create new units (e.g. Newton: "N = kg m s^-2").
 * Support for most of the SI prefixes, like nano, kilo, etc.
 * Output in three different forms: Plain text, LaTeX inline defintion and
   LaTeX fracs.
 * Output as a composed unit, e.g. "5 kg m / s^2" can be printed as "5 N".

+ Planed features

 * Parsing support for something like "N sqrt(m^2/s^2) * (A/s)^2".
 * Find best composed unit for unclear matches ("kg m^2 s^-2" -> "N m").

+ What programs are using unitlib?

At the moment unitlib is used by two programs:
 * slas2 for Mac OS X (http://sourceforge.net/projects/slas2/)
 * EinheitenRechner for Windows (http://github.com/borlox/EinheitenRechner/)

+ Author

At the moment unitlib is developed by Jan Kuechler. 
Email: kuchen_ <at> gmx <dot> de 
(yep, that's an underscore right after 'kuchen').

+ License

At the moment unitlib has no license, so effectivly that says "all rights 
reserved".
It's planned to release the library under an open source license at some point,
for the meantime just send me an email.



For any further questions, ideas, or anything else (except spam (-;), please 
send me an email.
